    excerpt: 'The Central Bank of Nigeria continues its tight monetary policy stance. Here\'s what investors should expect for T-bill rates this quarter.',
    content: `## Overview

The Nigerian Treasury Bills market has seen remarkable activity as we enter 2026. The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) maintains its hawkish monetary policy stance, keeping the benchmark interest rate elevated to combat persistent inflationary pressures.

## Current Market Conditions

Treasury bill rates have remained attractive for investors seeking relatively safe returns. The 364-day T-bill is currently yielding approximately 18.5%, reflecting the tight monetary conditions and investor demand for naira-denominated assets.

### Key Observations

- **Primary Market Auctions**: Oversubscription continues as institutional investors seek higher yields
- **Secondary Market Liquidity**: Trading volumes remain robust with healthy bid-ask spreads
- **Foreign Participation**: Limited but growing interest from offshore investors

## Investment Considerations

For retail investors looking to participate in the T-bill market, here are key factors to consider:

1. **Minimum Investment**: NGN 50,000 for most banks and brokers
2. **Holding Period**: 91, 182, or 364 days
3. **Tax Treatment**: Interest income is exempt from tax for individuals

## Looking Ahead

We anticipate the CBN will maintain current rates through Q1 2026, with potential adjustments depending on inflation trajectory and foreign exchange stability.`,
